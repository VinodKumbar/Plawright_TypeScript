JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used for transmitting data in web applications between a server and a client.

JSON is inbuilt in Playwright, allowing you to read and write JSON files easily. This is particularly useful for managing test data, such as user credentials or configuration settings.

Excel files are another common format for storing test data, especially for larger datasets. While Playwright does not have built-in support for reading Excel files, you can use third-party libraries like `xlsx` or `exceljs` to read and write Excel files in your tests.

npm install xlsx



Reading Excel Files
To read an Excel file, you can use the `xlsx` library. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to read data from an Excel file:

// File -> Workbook -> Sheets -> rows

```javascript
const XLSX = require('xlsx');
const workbook = XLSX.readFile('path/to/your/excel-file.xlsx');
const sheetName = workbook.SheetNames[0]; // Get the first sheet
const worksheet = workbook.Sheets[sheetName];
const jsonData = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet);
console.log(jsonData);
