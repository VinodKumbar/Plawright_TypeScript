Grouping Tests with test.describe.serial()

1. test.describe.serial is used to group multiple tests together.
2. .serial ensures the tests inside run sequentially, in the order written.
3. If one test fails, the next ones wonâ€™t run (unlike regular test.describe, where they run independently).
4. Useful when tests are dependent on each other (e.g., you must log in before adding to cart).
