/**
 * 1. What is Playwright?
 *  Its Open Source tool by Microsoft.
 * Playwright is a Framework for end-to-end testing of web applications.
 * Playwright is a Node.js library, that allows you to automate browser interactions. 
 * It provides a high-level API to control headless browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
 * We can automate both web and api testing using Playwright.
 * Playwright supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, and Java.
 * Playwright is designed to enable cross-browser testing, allowing developers to write tests that work across different browsers and platforms.
 * Web browsers supported by Playwright include Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

/* * 2. What is TypeScript?
 * TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It allows developers to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime, making code more robust and maintainable.
 * TypeScript is developed and maintained by Microsoft.
 * TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
 * 
 * JavaScript ---> Dynamically typed language

let age=30
let name="John"

age="thirty"


TypesScript --- Statically typed language

let age:number=30
let name:string="John"

age="thirty"
